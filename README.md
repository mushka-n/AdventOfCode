# Advent of Code

My first take on **Advent of Code** event.  

Im kinda new to this stuff and lowkey not trying to compete so with a high chance my name won't be on the leaderboard.  
My goals this year are mostly to practice, test myself and... have fun i guess?

All code written in `Typescript` with a `Deno` runtime.  
I've also set up a useful VSCode task to run `Deno` with a file watcher
